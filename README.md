In this application, I took data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ using Alamofire and Kinfisher and showed it to the user.

HOME PAGE :

1. I showed the currently showing movies using CollectionView. I made the movies scroll automatically using the Burata Timer feature.
2. I have listed upcoming movies and their features using TableView.
3. Using the SearchBar, I let the user search for the desired movie.
4. Clicking on any movie will display the Detail page.

DETAIL PAGE:
1. The image of the selected movie, imdb score, name and information about the movie are displayed.
2. Movies similar to the movie selected with CollectionView are displayed.
